A Openframeworks application for doing multi-headed additive manufacturing. The application is currently only working as a slicer. Long term goal is to optimize and generate toolpaths the indevidual extruders.

Currently under heavy development.

# Motivation

As a part of my research project, I wanted to create my own Slicer. The algorithms behind the slicer is
mostly motivated by the work presented in this [paper.](https://www.google.com)
