# fluffy-octo-potato

An application for creating and optimizing toolpaths for a 3D printing system consisting of multiple indevidual nozzles. 

## Getting the toolpaths - Slicing 

I´m creating my own mesh slicer as a separate addon to Openframeworks. This was a lot tougher then I first thought and very much still a work in progress. It´s documented [here](https://github.com/frikkfossdal/ofxSlicer). 

For now I´m using Cura to create my gcode, and python scripts to organize the gcode into a .json file. The python tools are linked [here](https://github.com/frikkfossdal/fluffy-octo-potato/tree/master/tools).
